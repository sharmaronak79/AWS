EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud - as name suggests elatic means it is scalable when u need u can increase size and at no need u can decrease it

there are basically 7 types of it;

1. general purpose instance
2. compute optmized instance
3. memory optimized instances ; there are differnet sries in this like ; D H I and they have some different number
4. storage optimized instances; R X Z ; which ever instances strat from this letter are comes in storage optimized instances
5. accelerated compute instances ; F ,P ,G ;F for FPGA whch is widely used in DSP image processing and we can say that in live strmaing like facebook live etc
6. high memory optimized instances
7. previous memory instaces ; which are out dated now or not much more in use
